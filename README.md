### _by [Wolf McNally](https://www.github.com/wolfmcnally) and [Christopher Allen](https://www.github.com/ChristopherA)_

LifeHashTool is a command line tool written in Swift that generates [LifeHash](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash) images as PNG files.

LifeHashTool is distributed as a Swift package.

## Status - Late Alpha

`LifeHashTool` is currently under active development and in the late alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.

## Installation Instructions

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHashTool.git
cd LifeHashTool/
```

Build the Debug version:

```sh
swift build
```

Build the Release version:

```sh
swift build -c release
```

Build and install the release version as `/usr/local/bin/lifehash`:

```sh
./install.sh
Password: [enter your password]
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** To avoid having to code sign, the `install.sh` script does not copy the executable: it only creates a symbolic link to it. So if you delete the `.build` directory from the `LifeHashTool` directory, the link will no longer resolve.

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** As of the release of LifeHash 6, LifeHashTool generates `.version2` LifeHashes by default.

## Usage Instructions

Print the help:

```sh
lifehash --help

Usage: lifehash [OPTION...] [INPUT]

  -v VERSION      [version1|version2|detailed|fiducial|grayscaleFiducial] (default: version2)
  -m MODULE_SIZE  Size of each module ("pixel") (default: 1)
  -p OUTPUT_PATH  (default: current directory)

  -h --help       Print this message.

* The output PNG file will have the same name as the INPUT string.

* If no INPUT string is provided, a random one will be generated of the form "XXX-XXX" where X is a random letter.
```

Generate a `version2`, 32x32 pixel LifeHash in the current directory from the string "0":

```sh
lifehash 0

ls
0.png
```

Generate a `detailed`, 64x64 pixel LifeHash in the current directory with a randomly generated name of the form "XXX-XXX" where X is a random letter.

```sh
lifehash -v detailed

ls
OKS-OID.png
```

Generate the same LifeHash as above, but use a module size of 8, resulting in a 512x512 image:

```sh
lifehash -v detailed -m 8 OKS-OID

ls
OKS-OID.png
```

Use the included `make-examples.sh` script to generate 30 `fiducial` LifeHashes with a module size of 8 in the directory `./output`:

```sh
./make-examples.sh fiducial 30 8

ls ./output
BUE-WZC.png DSP-IIK.png KHO-GQH.png LOV-CZL.png NFD-VWY.png TGE-JLS.png YBN-ZOU.png ZTW-ZWN.png
BZV-HHP.png EDB-HDG.png KIB-OFT.png LUV-VRB.png NNY-TRP.png THL-IRO.png ZJB-ZAS.png ZVS-BEH.png
CAJ-TQC.png ILF-JLC.png KPS-VYZ.png MMT-HRP.png RVG-VZO.png URG-VKN.png ZQS-QHK.png
DEZ-ZZS.png JBS-XMX.png KTG-XAW.png MOJ-SGW.png SSV-ZBF.png XFF-APN.png ZQZ-TEX.png
```

Use [ImageMagick `montage`](https://imagemagick.org/script/montage.php) to create a montage of the images you just generated:

```sh
montage output/* montage.jpg
open montage.jpg
```

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.
